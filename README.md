# Pizza-Sale-Analysis
Pizza sales analysis based on Data Science learning class Task

## Data Collection
The dataset I got from Techcrush Academy and was in .csv (comma separated value). Also, this dataset was already clean

The dataset consist are:
Orders: contains data customer, such an order ID, and when customers buy pizza (date and time)
Order details: what the customer bought
Pizzas: menu items of Pizza
Pizza types: type of pizza

### Data Preparation
The first step was to import all the libraries and read the data with pandas DataFrame and i merged all datasets together to form one complete dataset.

Before proceeding with the analysis, the dataset was subjected to data cleaning and preparation steps. Firstly, we checked for missing values in the dataset to ensure data integrity. Fortunately, no missing values were found, indicating a complete and reliable dataset. Secondly, we examined the dataset for any duplicate entries to eliminate redundancy and maintain data accuracy. These data-cleaning steps ensured that the dataset was ready for exploration and analysis, providing a solid foundation for deriving meaningful insights.


## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
I analyzed this dataset using Python.
Here are some things that I analyzed from this task:

1. What is the total revenue/sales?
2. Find the total quantity sold.
3. Find the total orders.
4. How many pizza types do they sell?
5. Find the average price of the pizzas.
6. What are the peak hours of sales?
7. Find the total sales made on each day of the week. Which day of the week is when sales are made the most?
8. Find the top 5 bestselling pizzas.
9. Find the sales made in each month. Any trend noticeable?
10. Are there pizza types that are not doing well on the menu?, and alot more

### Insights
1. The month with the Highest Sales: Based on the data analysis, it was found that the month with the highest sales was July 2015. This indicates a peak period of customer demand during that time.
2. Peak Hours: The analysis revealed that the peak hours for pizza orders were between 12–1 pm and 5–6 pm. This suggests that customers tend to place orders during lunchtime and early evening, which can be valuable information for resource allocation and staffing.
3. Highest Orders by Pizza Type: The pizza type “classic_dlx” emerged as the most popular choice among customers, with the highest number of orders. This indicates a preference for this particular pizza variant among the target audience.
4. Revenue Contribution per Pizza Size: Among the different pizza sizes, size L (Large) had the highest revenue contribution. This suggests that customers often opt for large pizza sizes, which can be leveraged for targeted marketing and promotional strategies.
5. Revenue for Each Pizza Type: The analysis further revealed that the “Thai Chicken” pizza type generated the highest revenue compared to other pizza types. This indicates a strong demand for this particular pizza variant and presents an opportunity to capitalize on its popularity.
